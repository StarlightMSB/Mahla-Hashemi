Hello  there , I'm a computer engineering graduate 
and I love to learn new things as well as doing internship :)
So far I have learned C++ ,C# , python , Java , HTML and CSS

although I don't have much experience with creating projects in real life , I'm looking forward to a chance to practice and use my skills in real life and projects.
